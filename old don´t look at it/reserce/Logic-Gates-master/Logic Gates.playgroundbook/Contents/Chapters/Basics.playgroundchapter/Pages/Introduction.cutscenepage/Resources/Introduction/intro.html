		<div>Shannon proved electronic circuits could solve all problems that Boolean algebra could. The thesis became the foundation of practical digital circuit design.</div>
		<div>“</div>
		<div>This calculus is shown to be exactly analogous to the calculus of propositions used in the symbolic study of logic. The circuit may then be immediately drawn from the equations.</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Claude Elwood Shannon
A Symbolic Analysis of Relay and Switching Circuits, 1938</div>
		<div>Boole introduced Boolean algebra, which has been fundamental in the development of digital electronics, and is provided for in all modern programming languages.

		<div>It appeared to me that, although logic might be viewed with reference to the idea of quantity, it had also another and a deeper system of relations.</div>
		<div>Logic gates are standardized physical devices which can be designed to implement Boolean algebra. Logic circuits can easily be assembled with logic gates.

Then we have multiplexers, registers, arithmetic logic units (ALUs), and computer memory, all the way up through complete microprocessors, which may contain more than 100 million gates. And finally, mobile phones, tablets, and laptops.

This playground will introduce you to logic gates, which are the very foundation of our digital life.
